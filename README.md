Dr. Semmelweis and Discovery of Handwash

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

This is a guided project which has been done on Datacamp website. 

Currenty, I am working on further exploring the data(without any guide) and trying to find other possible meaningful insights on it.
Further steps include possibly fitting a linear regression model on it and predict the deaths before and after introduction of handwash.
